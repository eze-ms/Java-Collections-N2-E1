# Restaurant Management - Preventing Duplicates

## 📄 Description
A Java program that manages a collection of restaurants, ensuring no duplicates are added based on the same **name** and **score**. This exercise uses `HashSet` to manage the collection and implements proper methods to avoid duplicates.

### Features
1. **Duplicate prevention:**
   - Implements the `equals` and `hashCode` methods in the `Restaurant` class.
   - Ensures no restaurants with the same **name** and **score** can exist in the `HashSet`.
2. **Display the collection:**
   - Iterates through the `HashSet` to show the unique restaurants.
